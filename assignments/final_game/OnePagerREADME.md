# FINAL GAME: FALL MAN
Fall Man is game about delving into a bottomless pit, avoiding large boulders and dangerous birds, in order to secure the best time in delving.
Fall Man is a repeatable score based game where there is no end if you are good enough, and you score can get higher forever.
Beware, as you continue to delve deeper, hostile boulders and birds will spawn more frequently to take one of your precious three Hearts.
Lose all your Hearts and you lose the game, having to start your delve all over. Challenge your friends to see who can get the highest score.

# Controls
Fall Man has a very simeple control scheme,
W A S D, to move
ESC, to restart your run

Very Easy huh?

Even more annoying guys to keep track of!

You might think that the sides of hole are safest from boulders, but these furious avians come out of their holes to find you there
